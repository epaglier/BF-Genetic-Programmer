BF Genetic Programmer

To run this program, run GeneticProgrammer.java's main function. The output will show the generation and the fitness of its best "Organism."

javac *.java

java GeneticProgrammer


To alter the program's output, add stuff to the target int ArrayList.

So far this algorithm only outputs ascii characters. It can theoretically be made to solve most math problems. Using Grammar in the "Organism's" allele/brain allows for a massive speedup in solving these tasks. Even though that is the case, it still can take a few hours to complete complicated tasks so give it time.

Included is also a BFToCode.java file that

javac *.java

java BFToCode (BF string)
